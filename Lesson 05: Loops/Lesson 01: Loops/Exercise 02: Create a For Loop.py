# A for loop lets us perform an action on each item in a list.
# Using each element of a list is known as iterating.

# Structure for loop
# for <temporary variable> in <list variable>:
#     <action>

# The temporary variable can be named whatever we want and does not need to be defined beforehand.

# Everything in the same level of indentation after the for loop declaration
# is included in the for loop, and run every iteration.

# If we forget to indent, weâ€™ll get an IndentationError.

#print(game)
  # Fixed IndentationError
