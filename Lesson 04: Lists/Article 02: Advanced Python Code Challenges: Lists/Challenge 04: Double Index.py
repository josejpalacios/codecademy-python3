# Create a function named double_index that has two parameters: a list named lst and a single number named index.

# The function should return a new list where all elements are the same as in lst except for the element at index.
# The element at index should be double the value of the element at index of the original lst.

# If index is not a valid index, the function should return the original list.

# For example, the following code should return [1,2,6,4] because the element at index 2 has been doubled:

# double_index([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
# After writing your function, un-comment the call to the function that we’ve provided for you to test your results.

#Write your function here
def double_index(lst, index):
  try:
    # Get element at index in lst
    element = lst[index]
    # Update value at index
    lst[index] = element * 2
    # Return lst
    return lst
  # Catch IndexError  
  except IndexError:
    # Return lst
    return lst

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(double_index([3, 8, -10, 12], 2))
