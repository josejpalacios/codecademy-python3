# A string can be thought of as a list of characters.

# Like any other list, each character in a string has an index.

# Itâ€™s important to note that indices of strings must be integers.

#If you were to try to select a non-integer index you would get a TypeError.

my_name = 'Jose'
first_initial = my_name[0]
