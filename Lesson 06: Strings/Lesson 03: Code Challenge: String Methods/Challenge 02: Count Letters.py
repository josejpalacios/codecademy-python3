# Write a function called unique_english_letters that takes the string word as a parameter.
# The function should return the total number of unique letters in the string.
# Uppercase and lowercase letters should be counted as different letters.

# Weâ€™ve given you a list of every uppercase and lower case letter in the English alphabet.
# It will be helpful to include that list in your function.

letters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Write your unique_english_letters function here:
def unique_english_letters(word):
  # Create counter variable
  counter = 0
  # Iterate through letters
  for letter in letters:
    # If letter in word
    if (letter in word):
      # Increment counter by 1
      counter += 1
  # Return counter
  return counter

# Uncomment these function calls to test your function:
print(unique_english_letters("mississippi"))
# should print 4
print(unique_english_letters("Apple"))
# should print 4
